# Atelo is a tool for installing and maintaining the Flutter.

- Features:

    - Flutter information (version, channel...);
    - Installation;
    - Switch channel;
    - Diagnostic;
    - Update Flutter;

- Build:

 - Inside the project folder, open the terminal and follow the steps:
    - Windows:
        flutter create .
        flutter build windows
    - Macos:
        flutter create .
        flutter build macos

If you just want to run the project, use the command, flutter run -d [operation system], after the command "flutter create .".

- Flutter and Dart version used in the build:

    - Flutter 1.24.0-3.0.pre - channel dev - Dart 2.11.0 (build 2.11.0-242.0.dev).

PS: I believe that there will be no problems, if later versions are used.
